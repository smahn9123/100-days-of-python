This div is a special HTML element that allows us to divide our content up on our web site so that we can structure each div separately.<br>
So essentially a div stands for a content division element and it basically allows you to split up or divide your content into separate containers or boxes so that you can affect the layout of each box separately.<br>
Divs can have a height if you specified it using the styles but you'll also have a height if it has content.<br>
<br>
Now the other thing to remember is that when we change the coordinate properties, for example in this case we're saying make the top corner property for this relatively positioned image 50 pixels, what that really means is that we're taking the top of where that image used to be and we're giving it a 50 pixel margin from the top of our current image.<br>
