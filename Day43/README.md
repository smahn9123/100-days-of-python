Everything in web page is just a whole bunch of boxes. <br>
The properties of these boxes can be affected by changing the CSS code. <br>
The <body> has some default values that prevents our changing the height.<br>
<br>
There is hierarchy among three different ways of implementing CSS:<br>
Inline CSS -> Internal CSS -> External CSS (Higher to lower order)<br>
You can apply a global CSS rule to all of your web pages,<br>
but on the individual web pages, you can apply more specific rules through using internal or inline CSS<br>
as more or less one off changes for that specific page or that specific element on that page.<br>
Now in terms of best practice as a web designer it's usually suggested that you implement all of your styles inside your external CSS.<br>
