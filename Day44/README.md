This div is a special HTML element that allows us to divide our content up on our web site so that we can structure each div separately.<br>
So essentially a div stands for a content division element and it basically allows you to split up or divide your content into separate containers or boxes so that you can affect the layout of each box separately.<br>
Divs can have a height if you specified it using the styles but you'll also have a height if it has content.<br>
